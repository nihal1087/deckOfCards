# 🃏 Game of War – Card Game 
The game keeps track of scores between the player and the computer.
A fun and interactive card game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where the player competes against the computer by drawing cards from a shuffled deck.
The game uses the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to fetch real card data and automatically determines the winner of each round.
